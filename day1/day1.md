## Homework

**Value types vs reference types nedir?**

### Value types _directly contain values_. These data types are all value types:

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort
When you pass a value type to a method and its value changed, the original value won't change.

### Reference type

Reference type _does **not** contain value directly_. A refence type holds a **pointer to another memory location that contains the data**. These are refence tyğes:
String, Arrays (even if their elements are value types), Class, Delegate
When a reference type is passed to a function, it does not create a copy of the variable like value type. It points to the address instead.
